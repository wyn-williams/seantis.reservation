    """ Takes a list of reservations, groups them by token and iterates
    through them, creating reservation record like objects which reference
    the first data found in the list of reservations and all the timespans
    combined.

    seantis.reservation assumes that a reservation with one token and many
    different reservations uses the same reservation data on all records
    linked by this token. This is less flexible, but a lot easier to
    explain and understand by the user.

    For example, take these reservations:

    id - token - data - start - end
    01 - 0xabc - x: 1 - 01.01 - 02.01
    02 - 0xabc - x: 1 - 02.01 - 03.01

    Fed into this class they iteration yields this result as
    a MinimalReservation:

    reservation {
        token     => '0xabc',
        data      => x: 1
        timespans => [(01.01, 02.01), (02.01, 03.01)]
    }

    It's really all about grouping reservations in a way that makes the
    result transparently usable by the reservation list view.
